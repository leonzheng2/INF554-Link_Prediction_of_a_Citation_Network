# Predicting Missing Links in a Citation Network

INF554 Machine Learning I (2018-2019, M. Vazirgiannis, Ecole polytechnique) final project - Guillaume Dufau, Christopher Murray, LÃ©on Zheng

The project is composed of two Python file, main.py and main_kaggle.py. The first one is used to work with the testing_set.txt, so that we can build our final model for the submission. The second file uses this model to create the submission file for Kaggle.

Uncomment the code in the files to try different possible lines to run (data visualization, model selection, hyperparameters tuning, etc.)

Data files needed for the project are in the /data directory.

A project report is provided in the "ML_report.pdf" file.
